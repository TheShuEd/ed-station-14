# ----------------
# Gameplay Design: Every ambition is to foster interaction between players in some way. The "I don't want to interact with anyone" ambition is a boring and bad ambition
#
# Possible variables:
# {$random_ent} - Random entity metadata name from a component entity list
# {$random_crew} - Another roundstart person except for the player himself
# {$random_location} - Random WarpPoint name in current map
#
# ----------------

# Items
ambition-items-1 = It would be nice to get my hands on a {$random_ent}.

# Social
ambition-social-1 = I want to spend as much time with {$random_crew} as possible.
ambition-social-2 = I don't want {$random_crew} to see me or know I exist.
ambition-social-3 = I've been wanting to get {$random_crew} drunk for a long time.
ambition-social-4 = I've been wanting to take {$random_crew} out for a romantic dinner for a long time.
ambition-social-5 = No one's supposed to talk to {$random_crew} but me.

# Locations
ambition-location-1 = God, I hate the {$random_location} in this station. I don't ever want to be there.
ambition-location-2 = Just love the {$random_location} at this station! I would love to do my work here.

# Complex (lower chance to roll, 2+ variables)
ambition-complex-1 = It would be cool to present a {$random_ent} to {$random_crew}
ambition-complex-2 = I can't help myself. I want the {$random_ent} in the {$random_location}. Or several. The more the better!
ambition-complex-3 = I'm sure {$random_crew} must really like being in the {$random_location}. I would like {$random_crew} to spend as much time there as possible.
